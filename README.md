to install GO , go to https://go.dev/dl/

to check if go is already installed , open terminal and write `go` , then a long help message will be appear on the screen.

and install GO extenction in VS code , just search Go and install.

after install , close directory , and open again , and make file . so in the bottom right there is `plaintext` change that to `GO` , after that in bottom right we will see yellow text something that says `analysis tools missing` , and click that , and install.

in `main.go` we have several questions :

1.  How do we run the code in our project?
2.  What does `package main` mean?
3.  What does `import "fmt"` mean ?
4.  What that `func` thing?
5.  How is the `main.go` file organized ?

Answer:

1.  `go run main.go`

different `go build` and `go run` is , go build just compile the program not execute.

if we run `go build` than we will get `main.exe` so this is an actual executable file that was built out of our source code of main go.

we can run it by `./main` or `./main.exe`

2.  A package is a collection of common source code files.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-008%20-%20what%20package.png?raw=true)

package can have many related file instide of it ,each file ending with a file extension of GO (.go). the only requirement for every file inside of a package is that the very first line of each file must declare the package that it belongs to.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-014%20-%20packages.png?raw=true)

inside of go , there are two different types of packages.

there is an executable type and a reusable type.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-012%20-%20types%20of%20packages.png?raw=true)

so how do we know if we are making an executable package or reusable?

the word `main` is ued to make executable type package.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-013%20-%20compiling.png?raw=true)

if we used any other name for our package besides Main , it would not spit out an actual excecutable file.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-013.5%20-%20reusable.png?raw=true)

so if we were trying to make some library of reusable code, or if we wanted share with our friend so they can use our code , than we would start using a more specialized package name.

so for summary :

3. `Import FMT `specially means give my package main access to all of the code and all the functonality that is contained inside of this other package called `fmt`.

FMT is the name of standard library package that is included with the go programming language by default.

FMT itself is a kind of a shortened form of the word format.

The FMT library is used to print out a lot af different information specially to the terminal , just to give you a better sense of debugging and stuff like that.

so for example main package could import FMT, but it could also immport in laike calculator or uploader pacakge.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-010%20-%20many%20imports.png?raw=true)

we can check library in https://pkg.go.dev/

4. Func is short for function inside of go .

5.

we will make some project.

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-000%20-%20cards.png?raw=true)

we make the project in folder `CARDS`

deal is get the card from deck.

> note: if we just write `fmt.Println` than vs code automate write `import "fmt"`

how to assignment :

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-003%20-%20assignment.png?raw=true)

or change that to `colon equal (:=)`

Go is a statically typed languange .

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-005%20-%20types.png?raw=true)

A dynamically typed languange is one in which you and i , the developers , essentially do not care what values we are assigning to any given varible.

---
basic go types :

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-004%20-%20types.png?raw=true)

we just use colon equal (:=) when we are defining a new variable , if we are reassigning a existing variable we just use equal (=)

varibale can initialize outside function , but cannot assign the value outside function.

---
for the function :

![Chat Preview](https://github.com/zainuddin-maker/Golang/blob/master/imgdiagram/diagrams-007%20-%20func.png?raw=true)

files in the same package do not have be imported into each other.example imagine we have 2 file :

main.go

```Golang
    package main

    func main() {
        printState()
    }

```

and
state.go

```Golang
package main

import "fmt"

func printState() {
    fmt.Println("California")
}

```

so if we run `go run main.go state.go` then all code will successfully compile because files in the same package do not have to be imported into each other.

GO has two basic data structures for handling lists of records :

1. Array -> fixed length list of things , cant add new value.
2. Slice -> An array that can grow or shrink.

whenever we have an array or a slice , every single record inside of it must be of an identical type.
