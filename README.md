 to install GO , go to https://go.dev/dl/

 to check if go is already installed , open terminal and write `go` , then a long help message will be appear on the screen.

 and install GO extenction in VS code , just search Go and install.

 after install , close directory , and open again , and make file . so in the bottom right there is `plaintext` change that to `GO` , after that in bottom right we will see yellow text something that says `analysis tools missing` , and click that , and install.

 in `main.go` we have several questions :

 1. How do we run the code in our project?
 2. What does `package main` mean?
 3. What does `import "fmt"` mean ?
 4. What that `func` thing?
 5. How is the `main.go` file organized ?

 Answer:

 1. `go run main.go`

 different `go build` and `go run` is , go build just compile the program not execute.

 if we run `go build` than we will get `main.exe` so this is an actual executable file that was built out of our source code of main go.

 we can run it by `./main` or `./main.exe`

 2. A package is a collection of common source code files.

 package can have many related file instide of it ,each file ending with a file extension of GO (.go). the only requirement for every file inside of a package is that the very first line of each file must declare the package that it belongs to.
