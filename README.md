 in `main.go` we have several questions :

 1. How do we run the code in our project?
 2. What does `package main` mean?
 3. What does `import "fmt"` mean ?
 4. What that `func` thing?
 5. How is the `main.go` file organized ?

 Answer:

 1. `go run main.go`

 different `go build` and `go run` is , go build just compile the program not execute.

 if we run `go build` than we will get `main.exe` so this is an actual executable file that was built out of our source code of main go.

 we can run it by `./main` or `./main.exe`
